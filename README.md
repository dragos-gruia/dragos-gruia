I'm Dragos Gruia, a researcher working on the intersection between digital health and computational neuroscience. Iâ€™m a big fan of open-source projects as they expand the accessibility and impact of research. Below are some of the projects I have been involved in during my PhD:

(2025)  - Led paper focused on applying mathematical modelling to solve challenges in remote digital health uptake https://github.com/dragos-gruia/computational_modelling_of_behaviour_in_stroke
(2024)  - Led paper focused on developing a novel digital health assessment technology for estimating clinically-meaningful digital biomarkers in stroke survivors https://github.com/dragos-gruia/Development_of_digital_biomarkers_for_stroke
(2023-2024) - Developed course materials in Python for a module in Computational Methods in Neuroscience, and taught the content within the MSc in Neuroscience at Imperial College London https://github.com/dragos-gruia/MSc-Neuroscience-Module3-ComputationalMethods-Development
(2023-2024) - Developed and taught course materials for a module that teaches data cleaning and data analysis using Python, and taught the content within the MSc in Neuroscience at Imperial College London https://github.com/dragos-gruia/MSc-Neuroscience-Python-Course-Development
