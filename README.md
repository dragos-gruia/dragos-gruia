I'm Dragos Gruia, a researcher working on the intersection between digital health and computational neuroscience. Iâ€™m a big fan of open-source projects and of sharing knowledge with others. Below are some of the projects I have been involved in during my PhD:

1. (2025)  - Led paper focused on developing a mathematical framework that improves the reliability and clinical utility of remote digital health assessments in patients struggling with physical/motor impairments. https://github.com/dragos-gruia/computational_modelling_of_behaviour_in_stroke
2. (2024)  - Led paper focused on developing a novel digital health assessment technology for deriving clinically-meaningful digital biomarkers in stroke survivors https://github.com/dragos-gruia/Development_of_digital_biomarkers_for_stroke
3. (2023-2024) - Developed course materials in Python for an MSc module in Computational Methods in Neuroscience, and taught the content within the MSc in Neuroscience at Imperial College London https://github.com/dragos-gruia/MSc-Neuroscience-Module3-ComputationalMethods-Development
4. (2023-2024) - Developed course materials for an MSc module that teaches data cleaning and data analysis using Python, and taught the content within the MSc in Neuroscience at Imperial College London https://github.com/dragos-gruia/MSc-Neuroscience-Python-Course-Development
